  Filename:     i2c_slave_send.c

  Description:  This example uses a slave to send data using I2C.

  Comments:     To execute this example, use the IAR project i2c_master_receive
                as the master. The slave's code must be executed before executing
                the master's code, since the slave is clocked by the Master.
                When a stop condition received, the LED1 will be set on the
                SmartRF05EB and the buffer index will be reset.

  Note:         On the SmartRF05EB, P0_6 and P0_7 is shared by the 
                EM_JOY_LEVEL and EM_LCD_CS signals. These have to be disconnected 
                by removing jumpers 7-8 and 3-4 on P10 I/O Connector. Thus the I2C 
                and SRF05EB LCD can't be used simultaneously.

                The I2C pins also have external pullups on the EM, at the as 
                required by the I2C standard.
