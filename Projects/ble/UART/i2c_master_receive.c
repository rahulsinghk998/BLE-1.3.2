  Filename:     i2c_master_receive.c

  Description:  This example uses a master to receive data from a slave using I2C.

  Comments:     To execute this example, use the IAR project i2c_slave_send
                as the slave. The slave's code must be executed before executing
                the master's code, since the slave is clocked by the Master. The
                bytes sent are simply numbers 0x00 upto BUFFER_SIZE. When bytes
                up to BUFFER_SIZE are sent, the example will end and LED1 will
                be set on the SmartRF05EB.

  Note:         On the SmartRF05EB, P0_6 and P0_7 from CC2543EM is shared by the 
                EM_JOY_LEVEL and EM_LCD_CS signals. These have to be disconnected 
                by removing jumpers 7-8 and 3-4 on P10 I/O Connector. Thus the I2C 
                and SRF05EB LCD can't be used simultaneously.

                The I2C pins also have external pullups on the EM, at the as 
                required by the I2C standard.
