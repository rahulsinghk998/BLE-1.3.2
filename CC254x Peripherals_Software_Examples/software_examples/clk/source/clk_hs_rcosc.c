  Description:  Set system clock source to High Speed RC oscillator (HS RCOSC)
                and set system clock speed = 2 Mhz.

                Initially, the HS RCOSC is not calibrated.
                To do so, the system clock source must be changed to the HS XOSC.
                Once the system clock source is HS XOSC then the chip will start
                calibrating both the HS RCOSC and the low power LS RCOSC. The
                LS RCOSC calibration takes about 2 ms. The calibration of LS
                RCOSC can be disabled prior to the clock change, by setting
                [SLEEPCMD.OSC32K_CALDIS = 1]. LS RSOSC is calibrated to
                32.753 kHz.
        
                The following is not possible before calibration is completed:
                 - Changing system clock source.
                 - Entering PM {1-3}.
