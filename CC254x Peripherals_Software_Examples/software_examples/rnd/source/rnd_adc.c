/*******************************************************************************
  Filename:    rnd_adc.c

  Description: This example generates a random number based on an ADC
               conversion. The ADC is set up for single, low resolution
               conversion on the temperature sensor. The result is used to seed
               the random number generator, which then clocks the LSFR once and
               hence generates a random number.

               The random number is stored as the variable rndNumber which can
               be read in debug mode. Note that the seed may be made more random
               if that is required. Please see comments further down.
