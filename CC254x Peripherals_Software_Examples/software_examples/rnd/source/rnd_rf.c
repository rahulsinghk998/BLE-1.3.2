/*******************************************************************************
  Filename:     rnd_rf.c

  Description:  This example generates several true-random numbers based on 
                radio noise measurements. The radio is enabled in RX mode without
                sync, and the radio ADC seeds the Random Number Generator.

                The random numbers are stored in the array "rndArray", which can
                be viewed by the debugger.
