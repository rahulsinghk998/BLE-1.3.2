 Description: Use of Timer 1 in Free Running mode. Channel 0 is used to
              capture events from P0_2 (P0_3 on the CC2544Dongle) on falling edge. 
              A channel 0 interrupt is generated when an event is captured. 
              In the ISR, LED1 (green LED2 on the CC2544Dongle) is toggled.

              For simple Timer 1 capture testing, connect PIN16 on Debug
              Connector P20 (button S2 on SmartRF05EB) to PIN 9 on Debug
              Connector P18 (P0_2), such that Button 2 can toggle the capture
              pin and thus feed Timer 1 capture with random pulses. On the 
              CC2544Dongle the button S1 is used. Note that the pulses fed 
              to the Timer 1 capture must have a duration longer than the 
              system clock. You can use the variable timer1Ch0CapResult to 
              read the captured value.

              Settings:
                - Channel 0
                - Free-running mode
                - Input capture on P0_2
                - Interrupt generated on capture
                - Default clock source and speed (HS RCOSC at 16 MHz)
                - 500 kHz tickspeed

  Notes:       The tickspeed is set via Timer 1's tick speed divider, there is
               also a global prescaler for Timer 1, Timer 3 and Timer 4 within
               the clock control register [CLKCONCMD].
