  Filename:     t1_free.c

  Description:  Uses Timer 1 to function in Free Running mode. Channel 0 is used to
                toggle P0_2 (P0_3 on the CC2544Dongle) when counter reaches compare 
                value (channel 0). Interrupt is generated when Timer 1 counter reaches 
                compare value. LED1 (Green LED2 on the CC2544Dongle) is toggled when 
                the channel 0 interrupt occurs. The LED should blink about 3 times 
                per second because of the frequency used. The variable timer1Ch0CmpResult 
                can be used for debugging.

                Settings:
                    - Channel 0
                    - Free-running mode
                    - Output compare mode with toggling on compare
                    - Interrupt generated on compare
                    - Default clock source and speed (RCOSC at 16 Mhz)
                    - 500 kHz tickspeed

  Notes:        The tickspeed is set via Timer 1's tick speed divider, there is
                also a global prescaler for Timer 1, Timer 3 and Timer 4 within
                the clock control register [CLKCONCMD].
