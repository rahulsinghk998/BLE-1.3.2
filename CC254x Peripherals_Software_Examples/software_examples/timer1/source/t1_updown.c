  Filename:     t1_updown.c

  Description:  Uses Timer 1 in up/down mode while toggling P0_4 (P1_0 on CC2544Dongle) 
                and generating [Timer 1 Channel 2] interrupt when counter reaches compare value,
                and [Timer 1 Channel 0] interrupt when counter wraps around zero.
                LED1 (Green LED1 on CC2544Dongle) is toggled when channel 2 interrupt occurs,
                while LED3 (Red LED2 on CC2544Dongle) is toggled when channel 0 interrupt occurs. The
                variables timer1Ch2CmpResult and timer1Ch0CmpResult can be used
                for debugging.

                Settings:
                    - Channel 0/2
                    - Up/Down mode
                    - Output compare mode with toggling on compare
                    - Interrupts generated from ch2 when counter reaches compare
                      value and from ch0 when counter turns around on zero.
                    - Default clock source and speed (HS RCOSC at 16 MHz)
                    - 125 kHz tickspeed

  Notes:        The tickspeed is set via Timer 1's tick speed divider, there is
                also a global prescaler for Timer 1, Timer 3 and Timer 4 within
                the clock control register [CLKCONCMD].
