  Description:  Uses Timer 1 to function in Modulo mode. Channel 0 is set up to 
                toggle P1_0 (P0_2 on CC2544Dongle) which is I/O location alternative 2. 
                P1_0 is connected to LED1 on the SmartRF05EB (Green LED1 on CC2544Dongle). 
                The Timer tick speed is set to 125 kHz. Channel 0 also controls the terminal 
                count value, which we set to 62500 to achieve toggling at 2 Hz.
                Default clock source and speed (HS RCOSC at 16 MHz).

  Description:  Uses Timer 1 to function in Modulo mode. Channel 1 is set up to 
                toggle P1_0 which is I/O location alternative 2 for CC2543 and 
                CC2545 and channel 2 for CC2541. P1_0 is
                connected to LED1 on the SmartRF05EB. 
                P0_2 is used on the CC2544Dongle.
                The Timer tick speed is
                set to 125 kHz. Channel 0 also controls the terminal count
                value, which we set to 62500 to achieve toggling at 2 Hz.
                Default clock source and speed (HS RCOSC at 16 MHz).

                Timer settings:
                    - Modulo mode
                    - Output compare mode with toggling on compare
                    - 125 kHz tickspeed
                    - Terminal count value 62500

  Notes:        The tickspeed is set via Timer 1's tick speed divider, there is
                also a global prescaler for Timer 1, Timer 3 and Timer 4 within
                the clock control register [CLKCONCMD].
