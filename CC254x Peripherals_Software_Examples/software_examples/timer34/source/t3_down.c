  Filename:    t3_down.c

  Description: Runs Timer 3 in down mode. Initially, LED1 (green LED on CC2544Dongle) 
               is turned on. When the Timer has counted down to 0x00, an interrupt 
               occurs, it turns LED1 (green LED on CC2544Dongle) off and LED3 
               (Red LED on CC2544Dongle) on. The LEDs are toggled by the interrupt, 
               not the peripheral I/O from the Timer.
