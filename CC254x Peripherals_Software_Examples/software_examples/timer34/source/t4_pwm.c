  Filename:     t4_pwm.c

  Description:  Generates a sine wave signal, by using Timer 4 to generate
                a PWM signal with varying duty cycle. The frequency f of the
                sine wave is
                                f = f_tts / (t4_div * 2 * t4_tcv * N)
  
                where f_tts is the Timer tick speed (can be adjusted in the
                CLKCON register), t4_div is the Timer 4 prescaler divider value
                (can be adjusted in the T4CTL register), t4_tcv is the Timer 4
                terminal count value (can be adjusted in the T4CC0 register) and
                N is the number of samples per sine wave.
    
                The values for adjusting the PWM duty cycle are stored in a
                lookup table, and this value sets the compare value for
                Timer 4, which is running in up/down mode, setting output on
                compare-up and clearing output on compare-down. The compare
                value is changed when Timer 4 reaches 0x00 (and generates an
                interrupt).
  

                On the SmartRF05EB, Timer 4 channel 1 is connected to P1_0 
                (GREEN LED1) for the CC2543EM and CC2545EM and to P1_1 
                (RED LED2) for the CC2541EM. On the CC2544Dongle Timer 4 
                channel 1 is connected to P0_2 (g0reen LED). I/O location 
                alternative 1 is chosen. 


                This example uses f_tts = 4 Mhz and t4_div = 128, to keep the
                pwm period above 120 Hz, to appear smooth to the eye with low 
                duty cycles. We use N = 16, and t4_tcv = 244 is used to fine
                tune a 4 Hz sine wave.
