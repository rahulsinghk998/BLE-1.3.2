/*******************************************************************************
 * Assembly file for handling alignment requirement for entering powermodes
 *
 * The PCON.IDLE = 1 instruction must be aligned to avoid FLASH access to remain
 * high and incur unnecessary power consumption. The PCON.IDLE = 1 instruction
 * must also be aligned in order to make the execution of the next instruction
 * deterministic. 
 * 
 * The provided methods EnterSleepModeDisableInterruptsOnWakeup and
 * EnterSleepModeProcessInterruptsOnWakeup ensure determnistic and predictable
 * behaviour with respect to this issue.
 *
 * Two more methods are also included to allow a pattern were a global variable
 * is written to PCON. This allows applications from safeguarding against
 * scenarios were interrupt is raised after the decision to enter sleepmode was
 * taken.
