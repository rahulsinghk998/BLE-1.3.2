  Description:  Example describing how to go into Power Mode 1

  Comments:     This code example shows how to correctly enter Power Mode 1 and
                wake up using an External Interrupt. The example uses Button 1 (S1)
                on SmartRF05EB (Button S1 on the CC2544Dongle) to generate the 
                External Interrupt. For test purpose, LED 1 (Green LED2 on the CC2544Dongle) 
                is used to show when the SoC enters and exits PM1. When the LED 1 
                (Green LED2 on the CC2544Dongle) is set, the SoC will stay in Active 
                Mode for some time before entering PM1 again, when the LED is cleared.

                Settings:
                  Interrupt:                        External Interrupt
                  System clock oscillator:          HS XOSC oscillator
                  Clock speed:                      32 Mhz
