  Filename:     flash_dma.c

  Description:  This example illustrates how to write data to flash memory using
                DMA. The DMA transfer method is the preferred way to write to the 
		flash memory, since when using the DMA to write to flash, the code 
		can be executed from within flash memory.

                The default system clock HS RCOSC (16 Mhz) or HS XOSC (32 Mhz)
                should be used.

                IAR might fail to show updated contents of flash, but if the
                debugger is restarted, the data should be visible unless the
                option "Erase flash" is chosen. The contents data written to
                flash is read back to RAM to check if the flash write succeeded.
