  Filename:     adc_cpu_poll_single.c

  Description:  This example performs single-ended, single channel CPU controlled
                ADC conversion.

                The ADC is set up for the following configuration:
                - Single-ended and single-channel conversion on PIN0_0
                - Reference Voltage is VDD on the AVDD pin
                - 12 bit resolution (512 dec rate)

                The ADC conversion will be CPU triggered, and the CPU will
                poll for end of ADC conversion.

                The system clock source is set to the HS XOSC, with no prescaling
                as recommended in the section "ADC Conversion timing" in the
                datasheet.

                PIN0_0 can be connected to the SRF05EB's potmeter by connecting
                PIN 17 on the P18 Debug Connector, with a wire, to PIN 12 on the
                P20 Debug Connector.

                The conversion result can be seen in the "adc_result" variable.

  Note:         The ADC result is always represented in two's complement form,
                as stated in section "ADC Conversion Result" in the datasheet.
