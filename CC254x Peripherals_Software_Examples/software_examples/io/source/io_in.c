  Filename:     io_in.c

  Description:  Setup one pin on port 0 to generate interrupts on incoming events.
                When a rising edge is detected on the pin, the ISR for the pin
                will be executed. This will toggle LED1 on SRF05EB or the 
                green LED1 on the CC2544Dongle. 

                The pin can be chosen using the P0_PIN macro.

                To test this, the pin that is set up, can be toggled with GND,
                for example using a wire from GND to the pin. 

                The debug interface uses the I/O pins P2_1 as Debug Data and
                P2_2 as Debug Clock during Debug mode. These I/O pins can be
                used as general purpose I/O only while the device is not in
                Debug mode. Thus the debug interface does not interfere with any
                peripheral I/O pins. If interrupt is enabled for port 2, the
                interrupt will be triggered continuously when in Debug mode.
